# TC

preprocessing code:

Angle code:
  -Used to calculate angle between vertebra and landmarks on the rib
  -In the top of the code the landmark (1, 3, 6, 8) on the rib can be entered with which the angle will be calculated
  -In folder line the folder can be changed from Postop, preop to control
  -All angels for all ribs of all files in this folder will be calculated and average and standard deviation as well
  -This will be done for 3D and 2D where in 2D the Z-positions (anterior-posterios) won't be takin into account
